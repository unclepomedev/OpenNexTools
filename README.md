# NexTools

A high-performance UV & Texture workflow suite for modern Blender.
NexTools is built from the ground up with Rust and Geometry Nodes, aiming to provide a non-destructive, fast, and stable experience for modern workflows.
Unlike legacy add-ons that rely on heavy Python loops, NexTools leverages compiled performance and Blender's latest architecture to handle high-poly meshes and complex UV operations instantly.

Currently under active development.

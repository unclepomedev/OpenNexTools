# NexTools

NexTools is a successor to TexTools, aiming for more modern UX, performance, and maintainability. The "Open" in the repository name signifies the goal of eventual community maintenance; therefore, maintainability is a core focus from the start.

NexTools will not inherit all features of TexTools. Instead, features will be implemented at the developer's discretion, starting with those of the highest priority.

Currently under active development.
